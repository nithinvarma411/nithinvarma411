## Hi there 👋, I'm Nithin Varma

## **<u>ABOUT ME</u>**

I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at Lovely Professional University (LPU), in collaboration with Kalvium, an innovative platform that offers a project-based learning approach to education. This unique curriculum provides me with the opportunity to work on real-world projects, fostering practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge.

As a student, I am building a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and algorithms (DSA), while continuously improving my problem-solving and critical thinking abilities. Currently, I am learning the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and deepening my understanding of DSA, which is sharpening my coding and development skills. Through my journey at Kalvium, I’m learning how to tackle complex challenges, innovate solutions, and collaborate effectively with peers and mentors.

I’m driven by the potential of technology to create positive impact and solve real-world problems. I thrive on tackling new challenges and continuously learning to improve my skills.

I’m excited to keep growing, stay curious, and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in tech!
