## Hi there 👋, I'm Nithin Varma

## 🔎 About Me

I am currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science** at *Lovely Professional University (LPU)*, in collaboration with **Kalvium**, an innovative platform that offers a project-based learning approach to education. This unique curriculum allows me to work on real-world projects, strengthening both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

I have built a solid foundation in **software development**, **data structures**, and **algorithms (DSA)**, while honing my **problem-solving** and **critical thinking** abilities. I have completed learning the **MERN stack** *(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)* and developed a full-fledged project named **Dhanapathrika**, a smart invoice and stock management system.  
👉 [**Project Link Here**](https://dhanapathrika.vercel.app/) <!-- Replace # with your actual project URL -->

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning **Golang**, focusing on backend development and exploring its potential to build high-performance systems.

I’m driven by the potential of technology to create a positive impact and solve real-world problems. I thrive on tackling new challenges and continuously learning to improve my skills.

I’m excited to keep growing, stay curious, and contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in tech!
